Common instructions for working on projects.

Functional Specifications
-------------------------

The functional specification document and parameters are not meant to be 100% exhaustive, 
but are meant to give a very good snapshot of how the product will work and the high level functionalities. 
As the programmer/developer you will be responsible for making the product work fluidly and without glitches. 
You are responsible for finding the things I didn’t think about, bringing them to my attention and moving forward.

Just because something is not in the functional specifications document does not mean it doesn’t need to be completed. 
I have provided a description explaining the overall purpose and functionality of the product. 
It is your responsibility to review the specifications and ensure that the product sticks 
to the overall vision and purpose and works the way described.

Please notify me before applying in case you find that there is something missing in the 
functional specifications document.


Working with GitHub
-------------------

Developer is expected to fork a GitHub branch he is working on (link will be provided).

All the work on the project must be submited through pull requests.

Developer must write clear commit messages.

### Using Issues

Please use GitHub Issues to ask questions and requesting additional explanations.


Code
----

### Changed code

Please put changed code in comments and add an explanation why it was changed.

Example:

```javascript
// bj; 2014-07-19; Get div.style directly. var div = document.getElementById('fld_'+idx);
var divstyle = document.getElementById('fld_'+idx).style;
```

* “By the elegance of their programs professionals are distinguished from amateurs.” – Dijkstra: “A Method of Programming“
* “Programming is the art of instructing a computer to perform a task. The key to accomplishing this feat is learning to think like a computer. Programming is one of the most mentally challenging tasks a human being can perform, but nothing compares to the satisfaction of engineering a piece of code to solve a specific problem.” – Steve Pavlina
* It‘s hard enough to find an error in your code when you‘re looking for it; it‘s even harder when you‘ve assumed your code is error-free. – Steve McConnell, Code Complete
